/* Exercise 2 from Chapter II.
 * The task is simple - just write your name and your adress. Of course, it's a joke,
 * nobody wants to show his home adress :D
 * That's the task: 
 *
 *  Напишите программу, выводящую ваше имя и адрес.
 *
 * So simple. I don't have to invent anything. Just keep it simple.                  */
