Thank you for visiting my repository!:)

All *.out files are compiled to run on Linux system. To run them just type in ./*.out in Terminal (I'm using Mint).

The chapter numeration in the book is a bit different because actually the first one doesn't contain C programming exercises.
So, in this repository Chapter_01 corresponds to Chapter 2, Chapter_02 to Chapter 3, etc..
